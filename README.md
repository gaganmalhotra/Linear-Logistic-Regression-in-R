Linear Regression:
Linear regression is the most commonly used predictive analysis technique. It is an approach for modeling relationship between dependent variable and one or more independent variable. This model attempts to fit a single line through the scatter plot, which can be denoted by the following formula- y=c+m*x, where y= estimated dependent variable, c=constant, m= regression coefficient, x= independent variable.
This type of regression model was the first to be used very extensively in practical applications due to the reason as the models which depend linearly on the unknown parameters are easier to fit.

Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression is a model where the dependent variable is categorical. It calculates the relationship between categorical dependent variable with one or more independent variables by using the logistic function to estimate the probabilities. Logistic regression can be binomial, ordinal or multinominal. Binary/Binomial logistic regression model deals with the dependent variable which has only two possible outcomes(example- “YES” and “NO”). Multinominal deals with dependent variable which has three or more outcomes.(example- “reason1”, “reason2” and “reason3”). Logistic regression is used to predict the output variable as compared to the continuous outcome.
